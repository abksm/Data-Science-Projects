I am Achraf BELKASMI, and in this repo you can find several projects I've had the chance to work on throughout the Data Scientist Professionnal Career Track on DataCamp. They consist mainly of importing, cleaning up and visualizing data from various sources, as well as  applying qualitative/quantitative statistical analysis and supervised/unsupervised machine learning on said data. The tasks were executed using Python and SQL, with many recurring libraries such as sklearn, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc. 

Thanks for your time !
